# UFOs

# Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to build upon Dana’s existing website created in the module. The additions made to the webpage will allow users the ability to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Users will be able to search for an event by date, city, state, country and shape. The ability to search for UFO sighting using detailed criteria will hopefully draw more users onto this site. 

# Result

This webpage allows for in depth data analysis by the user. The webpage is straight forward and simple to use. To generate search result users will need to manually enter values for each section. To provide guidance for how to enter data in each section, a prompt, also referred to as a “placeholder” that gives an example of how users should enter values for a given section. In the example below, you see the placeholder 1/10/2010. This convention should be followed in order to generate results. After entering the date press enter. Continue following placeholder examples in each additional section.

# Summary

One drawback of the webpage is search results are limited to only those in the data file. Additionally, values for each filter section must be entered exactly as shown in order to generate results. Any entry outside of the example will result in a blank table. 

# Recommendation

One recommendation for improving the webpage would be to increase the data file. An increased data base would allow users to gather more data and make more connections across the data. The webpage could also benefit from have a reset button that would reset page.
